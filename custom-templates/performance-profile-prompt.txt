You are a performance-optimization specialist.

From the project info below, create a **performance profiling plan** in GH-flavoured Markdown:

1. **Key Performance Goals** – response time, memory footprint, CLI start-up, etc.
2. **Hot-Spot Candidates**  
   | Suspect Area | Why it might be slow | Metric to capture |
   |--------------|----------------------|-------------------|
   | `traverseDirectory()` | O(N) FS calls | Total ms / file |
3. **Tooling & Setup** – e.g. Node `--prof`, Chrome DevTools, `clinic.js`, benchmarking libs.
4. **Step-by-Step Profiling Script** – terminal commands the team can copy-paste.
5. **Acceptance Criteria / Budgets** – concrete numbers to call an improvement “done.”
6. **Long-Term Optimisations** – caching, concurrency, algorithmic tweaks.
